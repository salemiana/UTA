# Module 07: Project 01

## Overview

Welcome to Project 01! This is an important step in your full-stack journey as you will now use your newly acquired skills and knowledge to build a web application from scratch. Along with your group, you will conceive and execute a design that solves a real-world problem by integrating data that is received from multiple server-side API requests.

Because you will be working collaboratively, you will learn agile development methodologies as you go. You'll also implement feature and bug fixes by using the Git branch workflow and pull requests.

## Key Topics

- [Server-side APIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_API)

- [Git branching workflow](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branching-Workflows)

- [Agile software development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development)

## Comprehension Check

You will be employer-ready if you can answer the following questions:

1. What is agile software development?
2. What is an MVP?
3. If you pull down a teammate's branch and you have merge conflicts, how do you handle it?

## Learning Objectives

You will be employer-competitive if you are able to:

- Speak technically about a feature you implemented in your project
- Explain and execute git branching workflow in a collaborative project
- Resolve merge conflicts
- Explain agile software development
- Design, build, and deploy a client-side web application using GitHub Pages
- Prepare a professional presentation and repository README for your project
